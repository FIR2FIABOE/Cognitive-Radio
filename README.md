    Simulation Study of Double Threshold Energy Detection Method for Cognitive Radios
    
  Cognitive Radio is a new paradigm in wireless
communication to tackle the problem of spectrum underutilization.
One of the important functions of cognitive radio is spectrum
sensing. There are many spectrum sensing algorithms available in
the literature out of which energy detection is widely used because
it is easy to implement and it does not require prior information
about PU (Primary User). However, the performance of the
conventional energy detector deteriorates in low SNR region.
Double threshold CSS (Cooperative Spectrum Sensing) was
introduced to increase the reliability of decision but at the cost of
some sensing information lost. 
  This projet give the different plot obtain in the paper which is discussing a
method of double threshold CSS in which each CR (Cognitive
Radio) sends local decision or observed energy to the FC (Fusion
Center) depending on the region in which the observed energy lies.
FC then makes a final decision by combining local decisions and
observed energy values.
